## Terraform AWS Infrastructure
This repository contains Terraform code for setting up AWS infrastructure, such as an EC2 instance and an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repository. Terraform modules are used to define the infrastructure in order to make it modular and manageable.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* Terraform is installed locally.

## Getting Started
To get started, follow these steps:


1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local environment.
   
```bash
https://github.com/TumisangF/Cloud-Programming.git
```
2. **Change to the infrastructure sub-directory.

```bash
cd '.\AWS Cloud Architecture\'
```

3. **Initialize terraform.

```bash
terraform init
```

4. **Review the changes that terraform is about to apply.

```bash
terraform plan
```

5. **Apply the Terraform configuration to create the infrastructure:.

```bash
terraform apply
```

## Follow these steps to replicate the Cloud Architecture:

**Change to the AWS Cloud Architecture**:
   The directory contains a dedicated IaC files that use Terraform tool to enable the clould archicture to be managable and replicable
```bash
cd '\AWS Cloud Architecture\'
```
