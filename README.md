# Cloud Programming

Welcome to the cloud programming project where I deployed a machine learning model on AWS Cloud Platform to make request and predictions via an IP address! This project showcases the process of building a machine learning model for predicting Titanic passenger survival and deploying it as a web application using Flask and Docker on AWS.

## Installation

Clone the repository to a computer locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TumisangF/Habit-Tracking-App.git
```
Navigate to the habit tracker directory.
```bash
cd Habit-Tracking-Application
```

## Usage
Follow the following steps to run the application

1. Run the following script
```python
python .\cli.py
```
As soon as the application launches, a menu of options will be displayed. Actions such as viewing habits, adding habits, crossing off to-do items, and obtaining analytics are all available for selection.

Observe the prompts and enter the information required as instructed by the application's interface.

For running the tests run the following commmand
```python
python -m pytest .\habitTrackerTest.py
```

Have fun monitoring your behavior and evaluating your development!
